# Rally Transbetxí

## About
Just like every year since 1988, the Rally Transbetxí returns to Betxí, Castellón (Spain), featuring a **unique motorsport event** – the motocultor rally. A motocultor is a small agricultural machine with no more than 10 horsepower. While its power might not be impressive, things change when we swap the original engine for a modified 250cc Bultaco engine, producing around 40 horsepower and reaching speeds of up to 100 kilometers per hour. Quite a transformation, right? 🏎️💨

With the increased power comes the need for improved brakes, suspensions, and tires. Even so, motocultores remain somewhat unstable, leading to the formation of two-member teams: a rider and a co-pilot who acts as a counterbalance during turns, much like a sidecar passenger.

This well-established competition revolves around this concept, and this year it introduces an exciting addition: an Android application that allows spectators to follow live timing results and get real-time updates on the race progress. Now you can stay connected with all the action happening on the track, witnessing the motocultores incredible speed and skill firsthand 

🏁 Join us as we celebrate the legacy of the **Rally Transbetxí**.
